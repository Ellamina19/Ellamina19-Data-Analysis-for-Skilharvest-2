## Project Overview
This is a columnar data that clearly shows how to properly clean our data before commencing any visualization. Let's dive into the process guysüíÉ
 
## Data Sources
The data source was shared by my facilitator 

## Tools Used
- Microsoft excel for fetching our data as well as previewing our dataset
- Power Bi for our data cleaning and visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
As earlier said, this data centres on how to carefully clean our data and derive a meaningful insights afterwards. We noticed that the Rows and columns are interchanged, so stay with me as we explore and clean this data üòÖ

## Power Bi Instruction Given
- First instruction given is by clearing the default prompt of power Bi by removing the changed type and removing the promoted header
- Next step taken is to transpose our data, by making the Rows to become the column and vice versa
- After that, I made my first Row as header
- I now went further to remove the null values by doing a column match by filling the null values down
- Lastly I went ahead to combine my years column as one column by doing an unpivot comumns, then I changed the data type under years to whole numbers

## Findings
![data](https://github.com/Ellamina19/Ellamina19-Data-Analysis-for-Skilharvest-2/blob/main/skillharvest%20visual.jpg)

- From the above visualizations, we realized that the highest sale was on 2006 and the lowest sale was done on 2009
- When we come to category, Bikes has the highest sales and the least sale was on Miscelleneous

## Conclusions
From the above explanation given on how to carefully clean my data, I can comfortably import any data and do the magic with it by cleaning it before visualizing.
Hope you can do that too ‚ùì
