This documentation covers mainly on how to do data cleaning before visualizing using power Bi

## Documentation Outline

## Project Overview
This is a columnar data that clearly shows how to properly clean our data before commencing any visualization. Let's dive into the process guysðŸ’ƒ
 
## Data Sources
The data source was shared by my facilitator 

## Tools Used
- Microsoft excel for fetching our data as well as previewing our dataset
- Power Bi for our data cleaning and visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
As earlier said, this data centres on how to carefully clean our data and derive a meaningful insights afterwards. We noticed that the Rows and columns are interchanged, so stay with me as we explore and clean this data ðŸ˜…

## Power Bi Instruction Given
- First instruction given is by clearing the default prompt of power Bi by removing the changed type and removing the promoted header
- Next step taken is to transpose our data, by making the Rows to become the column and vice versa
- After that, I made my first Row as header
- I now went further to remove the null values by doing a column match by filling the null values down
- Lastly I went ahead to combine my years column as one column by doing an unpivot comumns, then I changed the data type under years to whole numbers
